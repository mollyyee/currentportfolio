	<p> I tutored 2nd and 3rd graders in Oakland last fall. I noticed my students were constantly being taught that questions had one correct answer: in other words, convergent thinking. </p>
	<p> Convergent thinking is necessary and valuable. However, being trained in only one type of problem-solving may cause students to potentially lose the ability to think creatively and divergently. </p>

		<div class = "linesubtitle"> user testing </div>
		</div>		
	<p> We took the game to the classroom! </p>
	<p> During our user testing, we uncovered more problems and assumptions that we had about the way the game would work and the way classroom interactions work. </p>

	<p> Assumptions uncovered: </p>
	<ul class = "losebullets" id = "spacing2"> 
	<li>
	2nd - 3rd grade students are generally quiet individuals who don’t have opportunities to speak up in class. </li>
	<li> Students are good listeners. They will retain what others say and build off of existing conversation. </li>
	<li> Students will avoid fixating on things already said and will come up with original ideas each time a new student speaks. </li>
	<li> Students will let other students speak and wait their turn before adding to the discussion. </li>
	<li> It is the student’s natural inclination to want to obey authority- and they need to learn how to challenge authority instead. </li>
	<li> The students will focus on the task at hand in group activities. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> In my 2nd – 3rd grade classroom, order, authority, and focus are a few of the most important things that students learn. Students normally just want to verbalize whatever is on their mind and do whatever they want when given the chance. I personally did not speak up in class in elementary school. But I was not the end user. This class may have its own personality compared to other classes, but these characteristics made it difficult to play the game UNLESS the class was led by a strong teacher who was able to assert authority and moderate discussion. </p>
	<p> Observations: </p>
	<ul id = "spacing2">
	<li> Very chaotic game. </li>
	<li> Students got way too excited by the game, and it made them want to get out of their seats and start enacting different characteristic traits. </li>
	<li> Getting students excited but also focused is another issue. Though students say interesting things diverging off topic, creativity without structure or focus won’t be able to create anything. </li>
	</ul>
