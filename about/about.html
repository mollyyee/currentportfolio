    <p> I'm a maker, design thinker, and problem solver. I just graduated from UC Berkeley where I studied design thinking and human cognition (I made my own major)! I'm fascinated by the way people interact with the world around them, and I strive to create delightful experiences for people through digital interfaces.  </p>

    <p> I animate stuff with Aftereffects, write songs, and make gifs of my dog <a id = "button" href = "https://media.giphy.com/media/12uUYmWZvuZ5n2/giphy.gif"> Scout, </a> who's a <a id = "button" href = "https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aM2g7Onn5KfrDq/giphy.gif">happy, </a> <a id = "button" href = "https://media.giphy.com/media/uycAUzxnmqRnG/giphy.gif"> 4-legged, </a> <a id = "button" href = "https://media.giphy.com/media/zx0i840AAeTQY/giphy.gif"> sausage</a>. <p>
    <p> I've been watching framer.js tutorials, learning HTML and CSS, and checking out tech company's design pages.
    <p> I watch <a id = "button" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmb1tqYqyII"> The Office </a> and <a id = "button" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Katr63CBL8"> Pete Davidson</a> on repeat. (Pete's a standup comedian on SNL.) </p>
    <p> And I fantasize about becoming a writer for a sitcom. Right before finals week, I wrote and directed a parody of The Office called The Apartment (a tribute to my close friends who also happen to be my apartmentmates.) </p>
